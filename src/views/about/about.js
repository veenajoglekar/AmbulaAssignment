        At WebFX, our clients are always our top priority — but we firmly
        believe in creating an environment that’s more than just a place to
        work. Building a positive company culture has always been important to
        us, and as a result, we’ve been named the #1 Best Place to Work in PA
        six years in a row. And that’s not just because of the perks like our
        office in a renovated mansion, company bikes and kayaks, weekly yoga
        sessions, and in-house barista, either — though we know those certainly
        don’t hurt. But what truly sets WebFX apart is our dedication to
        positivity as the core of our company values. We strive to replace
        complaints with solutions, use challenges to our benefit, and bring
        energy and creativity to every project we take on. We also believe in
        the importance of improving the lives of others, which is why we
        established #FXBuilds in 2014. For every high-impact task we complete
        (like launching a new client website or earning a link from a top-tier
        publication), WebFX adds to the #FXBuilds fund, which we use to support
        organizations that provide education, shelter, and clean drinking water
        to people around the world. So far, we’ve impacted more than 6,500
        lives. In 2021, we also committed to cleaning 275+ football fields of
        plastic from waterways yearly and protect 100 acres of forest in
        Guatemala’s coast.
